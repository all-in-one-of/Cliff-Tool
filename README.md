## Technical Detail

The cliff generation procedure is based on Ubisoft's GDC talk. Only five steps: **Slope Thresholding, Preparing Geometry, Stratification, Split, Shape Construction** are seleted to implement.

### Slope Thresholding

Points with high slope are selected into a group. The threshold is ajustable.

### Preparing Geometry

High-slope-points-containing primitives are selected to be remeshed and subdivided.

### Stratification

Primitives after remeshing and subdivision are then converted to point selection. Those points are selected by this [VEX code](VEX/straticification).

The idea is to generate layered and separated boxes to server a the bounding volume in order to select points on cliff.

### Split

Points with high slope is divided into two goups according to 3D Perlin noise.

To have better orgnization, this step actually happens before the stratification step.

### Shape Construction

Shaper construction is extrusion + blur.

## Usability

### Parameter Exposion

The cliff generation network is wrapped in a subnetwork. The adjustable parameters are exposed to the subnetwork leve.

|Split Params|Peram Linking|

### Height Field

Height field workflow is Houdini's most powerful terrain editing tool. The tool(as a subnetwork) takes a heightfield as an input.

### Output

ID map, heightfield map and cliff mesh are baked using separated nodes.
